# Cellcounts_clocks
This repository contains the scripts used to perform the analyses described in Jonkman et al Probing epigenetic clocks as a rational markers of biological age using blood cell counts. Scripts are marked 01 to 05 to indicate the order in which they were run.

This repo contains both the raw R Markdown scripts as well as knitted HTML-reports, containing both scripts and output in an integrated format, generated by 'knitting' the scripts. These can be found in the 'Knitted scripts' folder, or using the links below:

* [Script 01 - Calculate EpiDISH cell counts and epigenetic clocks](https://thomasjonkmanlumc.github.io/Cellcounts_clocks/Knitted%20scripts/01_Calculate_epiDISH_and_clocks.html)
* [Script 02 - Analyze the association between age and cell counts](https://thomasjonkmanlumc.github.io/Cellcounts_clocks/Knitted%20scripts/02_age_and_cell_counts.html)
* [Script 03 - Analyze the association between epigenetic clocks and cell counts](https://thomasjonkmanlumc.github.io/Cellcounts_clocks/Knitted%20scripts/03_clocks_and_cell_counts.html)
* [Script 04 - Raise 1 cell type at the cost of all others (proportionally)](https://thomasjonkmanlumc.github.io/Cellcounts_clocks/Knitted%20scripts/04_raise_1ct_at_cost_of_others.html)
* [Script 05 - Generate and analyze artificial cell mixtures](https://thomasjonkmanlumc.github.io/Cellcounts_clocks/Knitted%20scripts/05_artificial_cell_mixtures.html)
